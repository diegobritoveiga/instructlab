      The 2024 Summer Olympics (French: Jeux olympiques d'été de 2024),
      officially the Games of the XXXIII Olympiad (French: Jeux de la XXXIIIe
      olympiade de l'ère moderne) and branded as Paris 2024, were an
      international multi-sport event held from 26 July to 11 August 2024 in
      France, with several events started from 24 July. Paris was the host city,
      with events (mainly football) held in 16 additional cities spread across
      metropolitan France, including the sailing centre in the second-largest
      city of France, Marseille, on the Mediterranean Sea, as well as one
      subsite for surfing in Tahiti, French Polynesia.

      Paris was awarded the Games at the 131st IOC Session in Lima, Peru, on 13 September 2017. After multiple withdrawals that left only Paris and Los Angeles in contention, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) approved a process to concurrently award the 2024 and 2028 Summer Olympics to the two remaining candidate cities; both bids were praised for their high technical plans and innovative ways to use a record-breaking number of existing and temporary facilities. Having previously hosted in 1900 and 1924, Paris became the second city ever to host the Summer Olympics three times (after London, which hosted the games in 1908, 1948, and 2012). Paris 2024 marked the centenary of Paris 1924 and Chamonix 1924 (the first Winter Olympics), as well as the sixth Olympic Games hosted by France (three Summer Olympics and three Winter Olympics) and the first with this distinction since the 1992 Winter Games in Albertville. The Summer Games returned to the traditional four-year Olympiad cycle, after the 2020 edition was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

      Paris 2024 featured the debut of breaking as an Olympic sport, and was the final Olympic Games held during the IOC presidency of Thomas Bach. The 2024 Games were expected to cost €9 billion. The opening ceremony was held outside of a stadium for the first time in modern Olympic history, as athletes were paraded by boat along the Seine. Paris 2024 was the first Olympics in history to reach full gender parity on the field of play, with equal numbers of male and female athletes.

      The United States topped the medal table for the fourth consecutive Summer Games and 19th time overall, with 40 gold and 126 total medals. China tied with the United States on gold (40), but finished second due to having fewer silvers; the nation won 91 medals overall. This is the first time a gold medal tie among the two most successful nations has occurred in Summer Olympic history. Japan finished third with 20 gold medals and sixth in the overall medal count. Australia finished fourth with 18 gold medals and fifth in the overall medal count. The host nation, France, finished fifth with 16 gold and 64 total medals, and fourth in the overall medal count. Dominica, Saint Lucia, Cape Verde and Albania won their first-ever Olympic medals, the former two both being gold, with Botswana and Guatemala also winning their first-ever gold medals. The Refugee Olympic Team also won their first-ever medal, a bronze in boxing. At the conclusion of the games, despite some controversies throughout relating to politics, logistics and conditions in the Olympic Village, the Games were considered a success by the press, Parisians and observers. The Paris Olympics broke all-time records for ticket sales, with more than 9.5 million tickets sold (12.1 million including the Paralympic Games).

  - context: >
      Having previously hosted the 1900 and 1924 Games, Paris did not attempt
      to host the Olympics again until it bid, unsuccessfully, for the 1992
      Games which were awarded to Barcelona. Subsequent bids for the 2008 and
      2012 Games were also unsuccessful, as they were awarded to Beijing and
      London, respectively. Undeterred, Paris decided to bid once more for the
      2024 edition, which would mark the centenary of its last Games. The six
      candidate cities were Paris, Hamburg, Boston, Budapest, Rome, and Los
      Angeles. The bidding process was slowed by withdrawals, political
      uncertainty, and rising costs. Boston surpassed Los Angeles, San
      Francisco, and Washington, DC, for the official U.S. bid. On 27 July 2015,
      Boston and the USOC mutually agreed to terminate Boston's bid to host the
      Games, partly because of mixed feelings among city residents. Hamburg
      withdrew its bid on 29 November 2015 after holding a referendum. Rome
      withdrew on 21 September 2016, citing fiscal difficulties. Budapest
      withdrew on 22 February 2017, after a petition against the bid collected
      more signatures than necessary for a referendum. Following these
      withdrawals, the IOC Executive Board met on 9 June 2017 in Lausanne,
      Switzerland, to discuss the 2024 and 2028 bid processes. The International
      Olympic Committee formally proposed electing the 2024 and 2028 Olympic
      host cities at the same time, a proposal which an Extraordinary IOC
      Session approved on 11 July 2017 in Lausanne. The IOC set up a process
      whereby the LA 2024 and Paris 2024 bid committees met with the IOC to
      discuss which city would host the Games in 2024 and 2028 and whether it
      was possible to select the host cities for both at the same time.
      Following the decision to award the two Games simultaneously, Paris was
      understood to be the preferred host for 2024. On 31 July 2017, the IOC
      announced Los Angeles as the sole candidate for 2028, enabling Paris to be
      confirmed as host for 2024. Both decisions were ratified at the 131st IOC
      Session on 13 September 2017.

      The opening ceremony began at 19:30 CEST (17:30 GMT) on 26 July 2024.
      Directed by Thomas Jolly, it was the first Summer Olympics opening
      ceremony to be held outside the traditional stadium setting (and the
      second ever after the 2018 Youth Olympic Games one, held at Plaza de la
      República in Buenos Aires); the parade of athletes was conducted as a boat
      parade along the Seine from Pont d'Austerlitz to Pont d'Iéna, and cultural
      segments took place at various landmarks along the route. Jolly stated
      that the ceremony would highlight notable moments in the history of
      France, with an overall theme of love and "shared humanity". The athletes
      then attended the official protocol at Jardins du Trocadéro, in front of
      the Eiffel Tower. Approximately 326,000 tickets were sold for viewing
      locations along the Seine, 222,000 of which were distributed primarily to
      the Games' volunteers, youth and low-income families, among others. The
      ceremony featured music performances by American musician Lady Gaga,
      French-Malian singer Aya Nakamura, heavy metal band Gojira and soprano
      Marina Viotti, Axelle Saint-Cirel (who sang the French national anthem "La
      Marseillaise" atop the Grand Palais), rapper Rim'K, Philippe Katerine (who
      portrayed the Greek god Dionysus), Juliette Armanet and Sofiane Pamart,
      and was closed by Canadian singer Céline Dion.

      The programme of the 2024 Summer Olympics featured 329 events in 32
      sports, encompassing a total of 48 disciplines. This included the 28
      "core" Olympic sports contested in 2016 and 2020, and 4 optional sports
      that were proposed by the Paris Organising Committee: breakdancing made
      its Olympic debut as an optional sport, while skateboarding, sport
      climbing, and surfing returned to the programme, having debuted at the
      2020 Summer Olympics. Four events were dropped from weightlifting. In
      canoeing, two sprint events were replaced with two slalom events, keeping
      the overall event total at 16. In sport climbing, the previous "combined"
      event was divided into two separate disciplines: speed climbing, and
      boulder-and-lead. When Paris was bidding for the Games in August 2017, the
      Paris Organising Committee announced an intention to hold talks with the
      IOC and professional esports organisations about the possibility of
      introducing competitive esports events in 2024. In July 2018, the IOC
      confirmed that esports would not be considered for the 2024 Olympics. At
      the 134th IOC Session in June 2019, the IOC approved the Paris Organising
      Committee's proposed optional sports of breaking (breakdance), along with
      skateboarding, sport climbing, and surfing, three sports that were first
      included in 2020. In the 2024 Paris Olympics, several new events and
      formats have been introduced. Formula Kite made its debut, described as
      the "Formula One of the Olympics", featuring high-speed foil racing with
      separate events for men and women. Kayak cross also debuted, where four
      athletes race against each other on a course with multiple gates, marking
      the first head-to-head race in Olympic canoe slalom history. Sport
      climbing returned with a new format, splitting into bouldering and lead
      combined events in addition to a speed event. 3x3 basketball, which
      debuted in Tokyo, was back with finals scheduled for August 5 at Place de
      La Concorde. Changes in other sports included the introduction of men's
      participation in artistic swimming, a new women's weight class in boxing,
      and the addition of a marathon race walk mixed relay in track and field.

      The closing ceremony was held at Stade de France on 11 August 2024, and
      thus marked the first time in any Olympic edition since Sarajevo 1984 that
      opening and closing ceremonies were held in different locations. Titled
      "Records", the ceremony was themed around a dystopian future, where the
      Olympic Games have disappeared, and a group of aliens reinvent it. It
      featured more than a hundred performers, including acrobats, dancers and
      circus artists. American actor Tom Cruise also appeared with American
      performers Red Hot Chili Peppers, Billie Eilish, Snoop Dogg, and H.E.R.
      during the LA28 Handover Celebration portion of the ceremony. The Antwerp
      Ceremony, in which the Olympic flag was handed to Los Angeles, the host
      city of the 2028 Summer Olympics, was produced by Ben Winston and his
      studio Fulwell 73.
